## Notes for Instructor

- Students submit their repository URL **once** at the beginning of the semester
- All labs are graded by checking the GitHub Actions status
- Students can resubmit unlimited times before the deadline
- The final GitHub Actions status at the deadline determines the grade
- Green checkmark = full credit, Red X = no credit
- Consider allowing 24-48 hour grace period with small penalty for late fixes
